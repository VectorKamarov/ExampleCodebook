# ExampleCodebook
This is an example of the codebook I've created as part of my project in my Data Analysis course in Spring 2023. This project required us to find raw data from databases and then clean them up to be useable for the public. 

I downloaded the data directly from World Bank's World Development Indicator database. I cleaned data then through pivoting and renaming the variables, as well as recoding all the NAs and giving IDs to all observations. Certain variables were also mutated to create simpler factor version. The variables were then moved into the correct order. I then created a function to record summarizing data for all variables to showcase in the final codebook.

Files for the project:

-`codebook assignment.pdf` Final output of the codebook  
-`codebook wdi.RData` Cleaned RData version of the dataset  
-`codebook wdi` Cleaned csv version of the dataset  
-`codebook original ALT.csv` The uncleaned original raw data  
-`codebook.R` The script of code used
